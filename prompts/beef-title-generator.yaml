template: |
  Your job is to write a short, punchy title for the "🥩 What's the Beef?" section of the newsletter. Think of it like a subhead — something fun, sharp, and informative that tees up what’s inside.

  Required Format: "🥩 Topic1, Topic2, Topic3"

  Instructions:
  1. Review the list of topics and the weekly recap.
  2. Pick 3–4 of the most timely, surprising, or representative topics from the list.
  3. Reframe them slightly to feel like headlines or ideas — not just raw keywords. (Example: use "AI red flags" instead of just "AI".)
  4. Combine them into a tight, comma-separated list.
  5. Return a single line in this format: "🥩 Topic1, Topic2, Topic3"

  You may use alliteration, wordplay, or juxtaposition — just keep it short and readable.

  Key Topics Provided: {{topics}}

  Weekly Recap Content (for context only):
  """
  {{weeklyRecap}}
  """

  Return ONLY the final title string in the exact format specified. No extra text, explanations, or punctuation.
